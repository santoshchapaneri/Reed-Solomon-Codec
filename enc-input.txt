An interesting result from information theory is the Wyner-Ziv theorem on source coding with side information at the decoder. It was proved that the minimum encoding rate for a source sequence X, for a certain distortion, when the side information Y‰BÔI
 is known only to the decoder, is greater than or equal to the rate obtained when the side information is available also at the encoder. Using the standard coded video as the side information, a Wyner-Ziv bitstream of the original video sequence is ·“‡YØgenerated as enhancement information. Parts of the original video stream that cannot be corrected by usual error concealment techniques can be recovered using this approach.

The research also attempts to address the issue of asymmetric video compAmã¥ô*ression based on Wyner-Ziv coding approach. The current video compression standards (MPEG-x, H.26x) perform interframe predictive coding (motion estimation) to exploit the temporal correlation between frames. As a result, the encoder is 5 to 10 timeF∆◊z≥s more complex than the decoder. However, some systems may require the dual scenario like in mobile wireless cameras/cellphones where the computation power and memory are scarce. In the Wyner-Ziv approach, light encoding is done while shifting the bø∏®≤‡urden of exploiting correlations to the decoder, using the side information. kùË!é
